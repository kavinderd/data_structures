#Data Structures
This repo is full of my implementations of various data structrues. Although this is a ruby repo, I'm trying not to implement these structs in a Ruby-way necessarily but a more canonical implementation.

##Array
Uses an internal array and provides the following methods

- <<
- []
- []=
- push
- pop
- find
- delete
- max
- min

## Sorted Array

A subclass of Array but it remains sorted with all operations

## Stack

## Queue

## LinkedList

## Double Ended List

## Sorted List

## Doubly LinkedList

## Binary Search Tree

## Red Black Tree

## 2-3-4 Trees

#TODO

- Hash Tables
- Heap
- Graph
- Weighted Graphs

# Algorithms

## Bubble Sort

## Insertion Sort

## Selection Sort

## Odd-Even Sort

## Mergesort

## Shellsort

## Quicksort

##Todo

- Radix Sort
